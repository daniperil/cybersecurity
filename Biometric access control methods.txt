Biometric access control methods:

1. Fingerprint recognition: This method uses a fingerprint scanner to capture and compare an individual's unique fingerprint pattern.

2. Facial recognition: This method uses a camera to capture and analyze an individual's facial features, such as the distance between the eyes and the shape of the jawline.

3. Iris recognition: This method uses a camera to capture and analyze an individual's unique iris pattern, which is the colored part of the eye.

4. Voice recognition: This method uses a microphone to capture and analyze an individual's voice pattern, including their tone, pitch, and accent.

5. Hand geometry: This method uses a scanner to capture and analyze an individual's hand size and shape, including the length and width of fingers and the shape of the palm.

6. Signature recognition: This method uses a digitizing tablet to capture and analyze an individual's unique signature pattern.

7. Gait recognition: This method uses motion sensors to capture and analyze an individual's unique walking pattern, including the length of their stride and the way they swing their arms.

8. Vein recognition: This method uses a scanner to capture and analyze an individual's unique vein pattern, which is located beneath the skin.

9. Ear recognition: This method uses a camera to capture and analyze an individual's unique ear shape and features.

10. DNA recognition: This method uses a genetic analysis to identify an individual's unique DNA sequence, which can be used for identification purposes.

Overall, each biometric control method has its own unique advantages and limitations, and the choice of method will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the smart home security system.
