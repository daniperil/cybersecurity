Traditional access control methods:

1. Key-based access control: This method involves the use of a physical key to unlock a door or other access point.

2. Password-based access control: This method involves the use of a password or PIN to gain access to a system or area.

3. Smart card-based access control: This method uses a plastic card with an embedded chip or magnetic stripe that is used to grant access to a system or area.

4. Proximity-based access control: This method involves the use of a small electronic device, such as a key fob or access card, that is waved or held close to a sensor to gain access.

5. Keypad-based access control: This method involves the use of a keypad or touchpad to enter a numerical code to gain access.

6. Intercom-based access control: This method involves the use of an intercom system to verify an individual's identity before granting access.

Overall, each traditional access control method has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of method will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the security system.
