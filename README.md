# cybersecurity

Definition: 
"Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communication services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and nonrepudiation."

History:
* In 1971 Bob Thompson made history by creating a program that is widely accepted as the first ever computer worm. The worm would bounce between computers, and it wasnÂ´t harmful however it would display a message on any infected system saying:
* "I'm a creeper, catch me if you can"

* In 1975 2 computer scientists realized the need for rules to govern computer systems. Jerome Saltzer and Michael Schoeder published: "The protection of information in computer systems"

* In 1983 The first US patent for cybersecurity was issued to the MIT for introducing the RSA Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptographic algorithm. 

*In 1986 the first computer virus for the MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) was released, name: The Brain.

*In 1989 Rober Morris created a computer worm that's considered the first Denial of Service or DOS attack to highlight Unix security issues. 

*In 2000 I LOVE YOU virus written in VBScript (Active scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual Basic) and with the use of social engineering techniques, infected millions of Windows computers worldwide within a few hours of its release.

*In 2010 Stuxnet: a Windows Trojan that attacks SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems was detected. 




The idea of an enhanced computer security is to use biomimicry, think of how living things defend themselves from biological viruses. It would make a computer system elastic and better able to defend against attack.
